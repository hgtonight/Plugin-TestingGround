Testing Ground
==============
A Vanilla Forums skeleton plugin in that adds its resources on every page, sets up a method on the settings controller,
and sets up a minicontroller attached to the plugin controller. I use this to test out new ideas and also jump start
new plugin development

It is released under the GPLv3 and may be released under a different license with permission.

Install
=======
1.	Drop the TestingGround folder into your vanilla/plugins folder.
2.	Enable the plugin in your dashboard
3.	Test out your ideas!
